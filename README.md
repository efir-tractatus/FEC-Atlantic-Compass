## General info

Project Catwalk comprises a complete redesign of a retail portal intended to revamp and modernize the site. The old client-facing retail web-portal has become significantly outdated and has been proven to be hurting sales numbers.
Built over the span of two weeks by a team of 3 engineers using Agile practices and progress tracking in a Trello board.
